The "Github poster":http://fr.linkfluence.net/posters/ is available as a PDF on the "linkfluence atlas":http://fr.linkfluence.net/insights-2-0/atlas/.

It's distributed under a "Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 Unported":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/ Creative Commons license, and you are free to print it.

It's optimized for a "A2":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A2_paper_size size. You shouldn't have any problem to print it at a bigger size though, as it's vectorial.

We ("linkfluence":http://linkfluence.net/) really wanted to print  and send the poster to people who were interested. But this is too complicated and too much work to handle by ourselves. If you do print a poster, please send us  a notice, for we would love to know where it may end up :)

However, for lazy/busy people, I plan to attend the following Perl conferences :

 * "French Perl Workshop":http://journeesperl.fr/fpw2010/
 * "Belgian Perl Workshop":http://www.perlworkshop.be/bpw2010/
 * "YAPC::EU":http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ye2010/

so if you are interested in buying a poster and contact me early enough, I'll print it and bring it with me. The cost should be between 35 and 50 euros per poster (this is the raw cost).

I would like to thank all the people who emailed me, and I'm really sorry I'm unable to provide each of you a poster.
