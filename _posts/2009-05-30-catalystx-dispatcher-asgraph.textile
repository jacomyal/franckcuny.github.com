This morning I saw "this post":http://marcus.nordaaker.com/2009/05/awesome-route-graph-with-mojoxroutesasgraph/ from marcus ramberg about "MojoX::Routes::AsGraph":http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MojoX::Routes::AsGraph. I liked the idea. But as I Catalyst instead of Mojo, I thought I could give a try and do the same thing for Catalyst dispatcher, and I've coded CatalystX::Dispatcher::AsGraph. For the moment only private actions are graphed.

You use it like this:

bc. perl bin/catalyst_graph_dispatcher.pl --appname Arkham --output routes.png

You can create a simple script to output as text if you prefer:

{% highlight perl %}
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use CatalystX::Dispatcher::AsGraph;

my $graph = CatalystX::Dispatcher::AsGraph->new_with_options();
$graph->run;
print $graph->graph->as_txt;
{% endhighlight %}

The code is on "github":http://github.com/franckcuny/CatalystX--Dispatcher--AsGraph/tree/master for the moment.

For thoses who are interested by visualization, I'll publish soon some (at least I think) really nice visualisations about CPAN, Perl, and his community, that we have created at "$work":http://rtgi.fr.
