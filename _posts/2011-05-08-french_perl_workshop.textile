h2. Where

The workshop will take place in Cité des Sciences in Paris. This is the same place as for last year OSDC.fr. The venue is easy to access using the subway (line 7), and there is a nice park to take a break or take a lunch.

h2. Talks

Yes, we need more talks :) We've already "accepted":http://journeesperl.fr/fpw2011/talks a little bit more than 10 talks, but we need *more* talks to fill the schedule. An introduction to Perl will also be organized in addition to the talks. We're also looking for some talks about Perl's success in entreprise. If you're using Perl at work, please, come to share with a captive audiance how you use it and how it's helpful.

h2. What

We will organize two dinners, one the thursday night, and a second the friday night. You should check the "wiki":http://journeesperl.fr/fpw2011/wiki to find more informations. (BooK is also looking for some people to join him to a concert :))

h2. Who

You! of course. This event will be nothing without you, your talk, and your presence. The whole organizers team is working hard to make this event a great conference. I also want to thank Laurent Boivin for all his efforts and pushing us to do our tasks.

If you happen to be in Paris next week during "Solution Linux":http://www.solutionslinux.fr/?lg=en, please, stop by to the French Mongueurs booth.

So, what are you waiting to register ?
